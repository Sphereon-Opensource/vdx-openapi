## Usage

This is a maven based project. To set it up locally for development, run following commands.

```
cd '<workspace>'
git clone git@github.com:Sphereon-OpenSource/vdx-openapi.git
cd dpp
```

### Generate API/Models (Future-work)

Uncomment contents of files to see project running.

```
src/main/java/com/sphereon/dpp/assets/api/*.java
```

The following command will generate the api/models in `<workspace>/vdx-external-vc-openapi/target/generated-sources/java/api/src/main/java/com/sphereon/vdx/evco`.
```
mvn clean install -P rest-api
```

Once the new openapi plugin is released (expected in few days/weeks), follow next steps.

Update the maven pom plugin. After the build succeeds. Spring boot application can be run just like a java console application.

```
com.sphereon.vdx.evco.VDXSwagger2SpringBoot
```

Logs may show something similar to following:
```
Started Application in 2.685 seconds (JVM running for 3.769)
```

The REST API can be accessed using the following URL e.g. from the PostMan Desktop Application:
```
http://localhost:8080/credentials/status
```
